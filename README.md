# Task2: Singleton

## Student Info
- Name: C. Allie Metzger

## Pattern: Singleton
### Implementation
To implement the Singleton pattern, I created a GameManager. The GameManager is mostly the same code as what was provided to us in the course through Canvas, but with a few changes. The first big change from the initial script was the addition of randomly generated coins. The second change was that once a player hits a certain score and thus changes the fire rate, a different bullet image is fired. This is an example of a Singleton pattern because all of the core gameplay loops are contained within the one GameManager script. This also includes things like managing the score, lives, and enemies killed updates.
